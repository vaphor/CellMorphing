(*
In this file, we give the main function of the program.
The goal of the program is to convert a horn problem in smt2 format 
into a horn problem in smt2 format with given types are abstracted.

To define a new abstraction, one needs to create an abstraction type (as defined in types.ml).

Once an abstraction is given, the program follows the following steps.

1) It parses the input file without understanding it : it only retrieves the well parenthesized expression
   This is done in horn_lexer.mll and horn_parser.mly.

2) We interpret the well parenthesized expressions : expressions starting with declare-fun and assert.
   This is done in interpret.ml

3) We apply the type abstraction and we recognize the abstract operation (without doing anything to them yet).
   This is done in transform.ml

4) We normalize the expression, so that we only need to abstract expressions of the form new_var = abstractop(...)
   This is done in normalization.ml

5) We finally abstract the operations.
   this is done in abstraction.ml

6) We simplify the expressions (get rid of tuples, ...)
   This is done in simplification.ml
